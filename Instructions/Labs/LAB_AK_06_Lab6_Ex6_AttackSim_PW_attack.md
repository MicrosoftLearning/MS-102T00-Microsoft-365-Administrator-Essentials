# Learning Path 6 - Lab 6 - Exercise 6 - Conduct a Drive-by URL attack using Attack Simulation training

Holly Dickson is concerned that some of the users at Adatum may require training about avoiding URL links to familiar websites that are either fake or have been hacked. This type of attack is known as a Drive-by URL attack. With this type of attack, a target receives an email containing a URL link, and when the target selects the link, they are taken to a website that runs background code whose sole purpose is to gather information about the target or deploy arbitrary code to their device. As part of her pilot project, Holly has decided to use the Microsoft 365 Attack simulation training feature to determine her users' susceptibility to Drive-by URL attacks.

### Task 1: Configure and launch a Drive-by URL attack 

In a Drive-by URL attack, the website attempting to lure the target will typically be a well-known website that has been compromised in some fashion, or a clone of a well-known website itself. The hacker hopes that familiarity with the website builds trust in the target, to the point where the target feels that it's safe to select the URL link. Holly wants to create a Drive-by URL attack using a rip-off of the Tailspin Toys website. Tailspin Toys is a nationally known toy store that is constantly offering promotions on TV and throughout social media. Holly wants to use this familiarity with the Tailspin Toys name brand to offer an enticing promotion for free toys as part of her attack simulation training. This will enable her to see how many Adatum employees are susceptible to this type of attack. 

In the prior lab, you created a simulation that was sent to all Adatum users. You also used an existing payload template for the simulation. In this lab exercise, you will only roll out the simulation to Lynne Robbins, and you will create your own custom payload.  

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. After the previous lab exercise, you should still be in the **Microsoft Defender** portal. If not, then in the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, under the **Admin centers** group in the navigation pane, select **Security**.

3. In the **Microsoft Defender** portal, you should still be on the **Attack simulation training** page; if not, then in the navigation pane, under the **Email & collaboration** section, select **Attack simulation training**.

4. On the **Attack Simulation training** page, the **Overview** tab is displayed by default. Select the **Simulations** tab, and then select the **+Launch a simulation** option that appears on the menu bar. This initiates the **Simulation** wizard.

If anything needs to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** option to make the change, or select **Back** to enter any of the information in the Configure section. Once everything is correct, select **Submit**. After a few moments you will receive a confirmation stating **New payload created**. Select **Done**. 

23. On the **Select payload and login page** window, the **Free gift offer** payload that you just created should appear in the list. Select the check box to the left of the **Free gift offer** payload, and then select **Next**. 

24. On the **Target Users** page, verify the **Include only specific users and groups** option is selected (if not, select it now), and then select **+Add Users**. 

25. In the **Add Users** pane that appears, in the **Search for Users or Groups** field at the top of the pane, enter **Lynne** and then hit Enter. In the list of users that appears whose name starts with Lynne, select **Lynne Robbins** and then select **Add 1 User(s)**.

26. On the **Target Users** page, Lynne Robbins should be displayed as the targeted user. Select **Next** and then select **Next** again on the **Exclude users** page. 

27. On the **Assign Training** page, under the **Preferences** section, the **Assign training for me (Recommended)** option should be selected by default (if not, select it now). Select the **Due Date** field. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **7 days after Simulation ends** and then select **Next**.

28. On the **Select Phish landing page** window, the **Global landing pages** tab should be displayed by default. Select the **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1** name to preview the page. 

29. A preview of the **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1** appears in the pane on the right. This preview panel provides an example of what the landing page will look like when someone experiences a Drive-by URL attack and the simulation uses **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. Scroll down through this preview panel and review the features of this template. When you're finished, select the **Close** button at the bottom of the preview panel. 

30. You will now look at some of the other landing page templates until you find one that you want to use for this simulation. On the **Select Phish landing page** window, select one of the other templates (select the name of the template and not its checkbox). Examine the preview panel and note how the landing page for this template is different from **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. When you're finished, select the **Close** button at the bottom of the preview panel.

31. Repeat the prior step and select another template. Note how this template is different from the other two you looked at.<br/>

	Repeat this step as many times as you would like until you find a template that you want to use for this simulation. Once you're satisfied with a template, select the checkbox for that template on the **Select Phish landing page** and then select **Next**.

32. On the **Select end user notification** page, choose how you want the end user to be notified. For the purpose of this lab, select **Microsoft default notification (recommended)**. In the list of notifications that appears, configure the following notifications:

	 - Microsoft default positive reinforcement notification - set **Delivery preferences** to **Deliver after simulation ends**
	 - Microsoft default training reminder notification - set **Delivery preferences** to  **Weekly**

33. Select **Next**.

34. On the **Launch Details** page, select the **Launch this simulation as soon as I'm done** option and then select **Next**.

35. On the **Review Simulation** page, review the entered information. If anything needs to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** option to make the change. Once everything is correct, select **Submit**. It may take a few minutes before you receive a confirmation stating **Simulation has been scheduled for launch**. Select **Done**.  <br/>

	**Note:** Once the simulated drive-by URL attack is launched, an email should be sent to Lynne Robbins. It can take up to 15 minutes for the email to be generated. Rather than waiting for the email to be generated, you will validate the email and review the diagnostic results of the attack in Exercise 7, task 5.

36. Leave your Edge browser and all tabs open and proceed to the next exercise.
