# Learning Path 6 - Lab 6 - Exercise 4 - Test the Default eDiscovery Alert

In this exercise you will test a default Microsoft 365 alert policy that notifies all tenant administrators, such as Holly Dickson, whenever an eDiscovery search has been created or exported.

**Note:** Creating an eDiscovery alert of this nature is important because an eDiscovery search, when left unregulated, can pull sensitive content that can be exported to an unauthorized source.

### Task 1 – Review the default eDiscovery Alert

In this task, you will verify whether a default Microsoft 365 alert is triggered when somebody in your tenant creates an eDiscovery search or exports data from an existing search. Since Holly Dickson is assigned the Global Administrator role, she is automatically a member of the Tenant Admins and will be one of the recipients of this alert. 

1. On **LON-CL1**, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. In your Edge browser, select the **Alert policy - Microsoft Defender** tab. This tab should still be displaying the **Alert policy** window from the prior lab exercise (if not, then in the navigation pane, select **Policies & rules** and then select **Alert policy**).

3. On the **Alert policy** page, you want to search through the default alert policies for a policy named **eDiscovery search started or exported**. Since there are so many pre-existing alert policies, the easiest way to locate the policy is to search for it. In the **Search** field at the top of the screen, enter **eDiscovery** and then hit Enter. 

4. In the policy list, select the **eDiscovery search started or exported** policy that appears. 

5. An **eDiscovery search started or exported** pane should appear. Scroll down through the pane and verify the default settings for this predefined policy are configured as follows:

	- Status: **On**
	
	- Conditions: Select the down arrow for the **Create alert settings** section to expand it, then verify the following settings:  <br/>

		- Conditions: **Activity is eDiscoverySearchStartedOrExported**

		- Aggregation: **Single event**

		- Scope: **All users**

	- Email recipients: Select the down arrow for the **Set your recipients** section to expand it, then verify the following settings:  <br/>

		- Recipients: **TenantAdmins**

		- Daily notification limit: **No limit**

6. At the top of the pane, select the **Edit policy** button.

7. On the **eDiscovery search started or exported** window that appears, the only setting that can be edited for this default policy is the **Email recipients** setting. This window enables you to edit the email recipients who are notified when this policy is triggered. You will not change the value here - you will leave it as **TenantAdmins**. Instead, the purpose of this step is to show you how to change the recipient list in your real-world implementations for any of the default system policies.  <br/>

	 Select the **Cancel** button at the bottom of the window.

8. On the **eDiscovery search started or exported** pane, select the **X** in the upper-right corner to close it. <br/>

	**Note:** You can also edit a policy's setting by selecting the vertical ellipsis icon under the **Actions** column at the far-right end of the policy's row on the **Alert Policy** window. 

9. Leave all the Edge browser tabs open for the next task.

You have now reviewed the default Microsoft 365 eDiscovery alert that notifies tenant admins when an eDiscovery search is created or exported.

### Task 2 – Test the default eDiscovery Alert

To test this default alert, Holly Dickson will create an eDiscovery search. This activity should trigger the alert policy, which should send an alert notification email to all Tenant Admins. Holly is a Global admin. By default, Global admins are members of the Tenant Admin group; therefore, she should receive the email notification generated by this alert. You will validate whether Holly received the email in Exercise 7 of this lab.

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. In your **Microsoft Edge** browser, open a new tab. 

3. In the new tab, navigate to **https://purview.microsoft.com**.

4. In the **Welcome to the new Microsoft Purview portal** dialog, select the checkbox next to **I agree to the terms** in the lower-left corner, and then select **Get started**.

5. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal, in the navigation pane, select **Solutions**, and then select **eDiscovery**.

6. Under **Classic eDiscovery**, select **Content Search**.

	>**Note**: Ensure you select **Content Search** and **NOT** the version with \(preview\) after its name.

7. The **Content search** window has two tabs - a **Search** tab and an **Export** tab. The **Search** tab is displayed by default. Select the **+New search** option that appears on the menu bar. This initiates the **New search** wizard.

8. In the **New search** wizard, on the **Name and description** page, enter **Confidential search** in the **Name** field and then select **Next**.

9. In the **Locations** page, the **Specific locations** option is selected by default. There are three groups of locations under this option, each of which can be turned On or Off through its respective toggle switch. Turn the toggle switch **On** for **Exchange mailboxes**, but leave the toggle switches **Off** for the other two locations. 

	**Note:** The **Included** setting is set to **All** by default. This value indicates that all mailboxes will be included in the search. In a real-world deployment, you can optionally select **Choose users, groups, or teams** to choose specific mailboxes if you wish. For this lab, leave the value set to **All** so that it searches all mailboxes.

	**Warning:** At least one of the three locations must be set to **On**; otherwise, you will receive an error.  

10. Select **Next**. <br/>

11. In the **Define your search conditions** page, enter **Confidential** in the **Enter keywords** field and then select **Next**.

12. In the **Review your search and create it** page, review the settings and edit any (if necessary) to make any corrections. Once all the search settings are correct, select **Submit**. 

13. On the **New search created** page, select **Done**.

14. On the **Content search** page, scroll to the far-right side of the page. Note the **Status** of the **Confidential search** is **Starting**. The search that you created should only take a couple of minutes to complete. After a minute or two, select **Refresh** on the menu bar to verify the status changed to **Completed**.

	**Note:** When you submit a new search, the system saves the search and then immediately runs it. By saving this eDiscovery search, the eDiscovery alert should be triggered, thereby creating an email notification that should be sent to the Inbox of all users with Tenant Admin permissions. It may take an additional 15 minutes for the email notification to be generated to validate this eDiscovery alert. Instead of waiting for this email to be generated, proceed to the next exercise. You will validate this alert email in Exercise 7, task 3 of this lab.
	
15.  Leave your browser open in LON-CL1 and do not close any of the tabs.
