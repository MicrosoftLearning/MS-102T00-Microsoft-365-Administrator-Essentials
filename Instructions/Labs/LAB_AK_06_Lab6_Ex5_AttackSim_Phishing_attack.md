# Learning Path 6 - Lab 6 - Exercise 5 - Conduct a Spear Phishing attack using Attack Simulation training

Holly Dickson is concerned that some users at Adatum may require education about phishing attacks. As part of her pilot project, Holly has decided to use the Microsoft 365 Attack simulation training feature to determine her users' susceptibility to phishing attacks.

**Important:** To use Microsoft's Attack Simulation training feature to simulate a phishing attack, the administrator who runs the simulation must be enabled for Multifactor Authentication (MFA). Since Holly is a member of the Microsoft 365 pilot project group that is excluded from MFA per the Conditional Access policy that you created in an earlier lab, she isn't required to use MFA. So in order to run the Attack Simulation training, you must turn on MFA for Holly's user account. While most organizations will typically use Conditional Access to implement MFA - just as you did previously - you can optionally turn on MFA for a specific user account. Microsoft recommends that from a security standpoint, it's best to use this option on an exception or as needed basis. This training session is one of those situations, so you will use this method to enable Holly to complete this attack simulation training exercise.

### Task 1: Enable Multifactor Authentication for the attack simulation admin

To use Microsoft's Attack simulation training feature to simulate a phishing attack, the admin who will run the simulation must be enabled for MFA. Since Holly is part of the Microsoft 365 pilot project group that she excluded from MFA in the earlier Conditional Access policy, she will enable MFA for her user account only. After she finishes running the Attack simulation training, she will disable MFA for her account. 

**Important:** To implement MFA for Holly's account, you must use your mobile phone to receive a verification code so that you can enter it into your tenant as Holly's second form of authentication. If you don't have a phone, you will have to skip this lab. If this is the case, notify your instructor, who can potentially partner you with another student to follow along through this lab.

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**.  

2. To enable MFA for Holly Dickson's user account, select the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab in your browser. In the navigation pane, select **Users** and then select **Active users**.

3. In the **Active users** window, on the menu bar at the top of the user list, select **Multi-factor authentication**. If this option does not appear on the menu bar, select the **ellipsis (More actions)** icon, and in the drop-down menu that appears, select  **Multi-factor authentication**.

4. A **multi-factor authentication** window appears in a new Edge browser tab. The **users** tab is displayed by default. Note the MFA status for all existing user accounts is **Disabled**. The Conditional Access policy that you created earlier does NOT enable the MFA status for each individual user. Rather, that policy is dynamically applied at each user sign-in to determine whether MFA is required for the user who is signing in. If MFA is not applied to a user based on the policy, then the user's individual MFA status is checked on their account. <br>

	Select the check box for **Holly Dickson** (the .onmicrosoft version), and in Holly's properties pane that appears on the right, select **Enable** under the **quick steps** section.

5. On the **About enabling multi-factor auth** dialog box that appears, select the **enable multi-factor auth** button. When the **Updates successful** dialog box appears, select **close**.

6. In the **multi-factor authentication** window, verify that Holly's MFA Status has changed to **Enabled**. 

7. Close the **Multi-factor authentication** tab in your Edge browser. This should return you to the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab.

8. You must now sign out of Microsoft 365 as Holly, close your browser session (to clear cache), open a new session, and then log back into Microsoft 365 as Holly using MFA. The first time you sign back in after having MFA enabled for your user account, you will be asked for the authentication information needed for MFA, such as your phone number and authentication options. You will then be texted a verification code to validate the authentication process works. You will perform these steps in the remaining portion of this task.<br/>

	You must begin by signing out of Microsoft 365 as Holly, so select the **HD** user icon in the upper right corner of the browser and in the **Holly Dickson** window that appears, select **Sign out**. 

9. Once you are signed out, close your Edge browser.

10. Select the **Edge** icon on your taskbar to open a new browser session. In your browser go to the **Microsoft 365 Home** page by entering the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com/** 

11. In the **Pick an account** window, select **Holly@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider) and then select **Next**. In the **Enter password** window, enter the new Administrative Password that you assigned to Holly's account. Select **Sign in**.

12. Because MFA is enabled for Holly, a **More information required** window appears. Select **Next**.

13. On the **Microsoft Authenticator** page that appears, you can download this mobile app or use a different method for MFA verification. For the purposes of this lab, we recommend you use your mobile phone so that you do not have to take time installing the Microsoft Authenticator app that you may not use again after this training class. Select the **I want to set up a different method** option at the bottom of the page (**Important:** Do NOT confuse this link with the **I want to use a different authenticator app** that appears above it). 

14. On the **Choose a different method** dialog box that appears, select the drop-down arrow in the **Which method would you like to use?** field, select **Phone**, and then select **Confirm**. 

15. In the **Phone** window that appears, under **What phone number would you like to use?** field, select your country or region, and then in the field next to it, enter your phone number (use your country specific formatting). Verify the **Receive a code** option is selected and then select **Next**.

16. Retrieve the verification code from the text message that is sent to your phone.

17. In the **Phone** window, enter the 6-digit verification code in the code field and then select **Next**. When the **Phone** window displays a message indicating your phone was registered successfully, select **Next**.

18. On the **Success!** page, select **Done**.

19. If a **Stay signed in?** dialog box appears, select the **Donâ€™t show this again** check box and then select **Yes.** 

20. On the **Home | Microsoft 365** tab, select the **Admin** icon that appears in the column of app icons on the side of the screen. This opens the **Microsoft 365 admin center** in a new browser tab. 

21. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Show all** in the navigation pane. Under **Admin centers**, select **Security**. This will open the **Microsoft Defender** portal. You will resume from here in the next task when you launch a spear phishing attack using Attack simulation training.  

22. You have now configured MFA for Holly Dickson, you have signed into the Microsoft 365 admin center as Holly using MFA, and you're ready to run the Attack simulator training in the Microsoft Defender portal. Leave everything as is in your VM and proceed to the next task.


### Task 2: Configure and launch a Spear Phishing attack

Microsoft 365 includes an Attack simulation training feature that enables you to create simulations and run them against all your users or a select group of users. Each phishing attack includes what is referred to as the "payload", which is the message in the system-generated email that contains the malicious component hackers use to gather information, deposit malicious code, and so on. The Attack simulation training feature includes a number of payload templates that you can choose from, and you can create your own payload if you so desire. 

In this lab exercise, you will use one of the existing payload templates. In the next lab exercise, you will create your own custom payload.

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as **Holly Dickson**. 

2. You should still have the **Microsoft Defender** portal open in your **Edge** browser from the prior task. If not, enter **https://security.microsoft.com** in the address bar, and then if you receive a dialog box asking for a second form of authentication, proceed through the verification process. If not, sign-in as Holly using the **Administrative username** and **Administrative password** provided by your lab-hosting provider and if required, complete the MFA sign-in process.

3. In the **Microsoft Defender** portal, under the **Email & collaboration** section in the navigation pane, select **Attack simulation training**. If a **Welcome to Attack simulation training** window appears, select **Close**.

4. On the **Attack simulation training** page, Holly has decided to conduct a simulated account breach in which she will use a URL to try and obtain usernames and passwords. This is referred to in the Attack Simulator as a **Credentials Harvest** attack. <br/>

	Note the tabs that appear across the top of the **Attack simulation training** page (where the **Overview** tab is displayed by default). You can launch this attack either from **Simulations** tab or by selecting the **Launch a simulation** link on the **Overview** tab. Since the **Overview** tab has additional information and is the default page when selecting the **Attack simulation training** service, it is recommended that you launch it from there so that you can learn about the specifics of this type of attack. <br/>
	
	On the **Overview** tab, scroll down to the **Recommendations** section. You may need to scroll up or down in this section to see the **Launch a phishing simulation using other social engineering techniques** recommendation. Under this recommended attack, select **Create another simulation with new technique**. This initiates the **Create Simulation** wizard.

5. On the **Select Technique** page, review the specific information related to the **Credentials Harvest** attack type option. At the bottom of the **Credential Harvest** option, select the **View details of Credential harvest** link. This opens a **Credential Harvest** pane on the right. Review the **Description** and the **Simulation steps** for this type of attack. When you're done, close the **Credential Harvest** pane.

6. On the **Select Technique** page, select the **Credentials Harvest** attack type if it's not already selected by default, and then select **Next**.

7. In the **Simulation** wizard, the steps involved in the simulation are displayed in the side pane. While you can manually create a phishing campaign, it is recommended that you take advantage of the available templates that will prefill most of the information for you. The key to a successful phishing attack is to create a very intriguing, real-world looking email, and the templates provide very creative solutions. <br/>

	On the **Name Simulation** page, provide the following information: 
	- Simulation Name: **PhishingTest1**
	- Description: **This simulation provides insight on targeted email threats against users inside the company**

8. Select **Next**.

9. On the **Select payload and login page** window, select the check box to the left of the **Payment for Package** payload. Select **Next**.

	**Note:** If the **Payment for Package** payload does not appear, select another Payload of your choice. A payload is the link or attachment in the simulated phishing email message that's presented to users. In the real-world, you'd want to use a payload that works best for your organization.

11. On the **Target Users** page, select the **Include all users in my organization** option. This will display all of Adatum's users. Select **Next**, and then on the **Exclude users** page, select **Next** again.

12. On the **Assign Training** page, under the **Preferences** section, the **Assign training for me (Recommended)** option should be selected by default (if not, select it now). Select the **Due Date** field. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **7 days after Simulation ends** and then select **Next**.

13. On the **Select Phish landing page** window, scroll down to the **Global landing pages** tab, which should be displayed by default. This tab displays a list of predefined landing page templates. Select the **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1** name to preview the page. 

14. A preview of the **Microsoft landing page** for this template appears in a new pane. This preview pane provides an example of what the landing page will look like when someone experiences a phishing attack and the simulation uses **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. Scroll down through this preview panel and review the features. When you're finished, select the **Close** button at the bottom of the preview pane. 

15. You will now look at some of the other landing page templates until you find one that you want to use for this simulation. On the **Select Phish landing page** window, select one of the other templates (select the name of the template and not its checkbox). Examine the preview pane and note how the landing page for this template is different from **Microsoft Landing Page Template 1**. When you're finished, select the **Close** button at the bottom of the preview pane.

16. Repeat the prior step and select another template. Note how this template is different from the other two you looked at. <br/>

	Repeat this step as many times as you would like until you find a template that you want to use for this simulation. When you're finished reviewing templates, select the checkbox for the template that you want to use on the **Select Phish landing page** and then select **Next**.

17. On the **Select end user notification** page, choose how you want the end user to be notified. For the purpose of this lab, select **Microsoft default notification (recommended)**. In the list of notifications that appears, configure the following notifications:

	 - Microsoft default positive reinforcement notification - set **Delivery preferences** to **Deliver after simulation ends**
	 - Microsoft default training reminder notification - set **Delivery preferences** to  **Weekly**

18. Select **Next**.

19. On the **Launch Details** page, select the **Launch this simulation as soon as I'm done** option and then select **Next**.

20. On the **Review Simulation** page, review the entered information. If anything needs to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** option to make the change. Once everything is correct, select **Submit**. It may take a few minutes before you receive a confirmation stating **Simulation has been scheduled for launch**. Select **Done**. <br/>

	**Note:** Once the simulated spear phishing attack is launched, it may take up to 15 minutes for the system to generate the email and send it to all Adatum users. Rather than waiting for the email to be generated, you will validate the email and review the diagnostic results of the attack in Exercise 7, task 4.

21. Leave your Edge browser and all tabs open and proceed to the next exercise.
