# Learning Path 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 3 - Add a Custom Domain

When a company purchases Microsoft 365, they are typically provided with a default domain name in the format of **companyname.onmicrosoft.com**. The "companyname" in companyname.onmicrosoft.com is a placeholder for the actual name of the company that purchases Microsoft 365. This default domain name is assigned by Microsoft during the sign-up process and is unique to the organization. It serves as an initial domain that can be used to access Microsoft 365 services immediately. 

However, most companies expect to attach their business domain after purchasing Microsoft 365. This "business domain" refers to a custom domain name that the company already owns or purchases separately (such as contoso.com). Companies often prefer to use their business domain with Microsoft 365 services because it aligns with their branding and makes it easier for their users to remember their email addresses and other identifiers (for example, JamesR@contoso.com).

Not every company has just one domain; in fact, many companies have more than one domain. In this lab scenario, Adatum has just purchased a new domain (xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx; the exact name of which is provided by your lab hosting provider) that resides in Microsoft Azure but not in Adatum's on-premises environment. To support Adatum’s new custom domain, your lab hosting provider took on the role of Adatum’s third-party domain registrar. 

In this exercise, you will gain experience adding this domain to Adatum' Microsoft 365 deployment. When you add a domain to Microsoft 365, it's called an accepted, or custom domain. Custom domains allow companies to have their own branding on emails and accounts so that customers can verify who is emailing them (for example, @contoso.com). Adding a new domain is a three-step process:

 - You must first add a new zone for the domain in your on-premises DNS.
 - You must add the domain in Microsoft 365. 
 - When adding the new domain in Microsoft 365, you must also add the corresponding DNS records to the domain in DNS. These DNS records are necessary to support the services required by the company for the new domain. 

**NOTE:** Most companies do not personally manage their domains' DNS records themselves; instead, they have a third-party resource that manages these records for them. To assist in this effort, Microsoft 365 provides certain third-party domain registrars with an automation tool that automatically adds and replaces a company’s DNS records. The automation tool also federates the sign-in credentials for the third-party registrars and Microsoft 365. Using a tool to automatically maintain DNS records is a much-welcomed improvement from the days when companies had to manually maintain these records, which oftentimes introduced human error into a rather complicated process. Because these tools eliminate the need to manually add the DNS records, they eliminate human error from the process.

**However, for the purpose of this lab, you will be asked to manually create the necessary DNS records required by this new custom domain so that you gain experience and understanding of what the DNS records are about, and why they are required for a new domain.**

### Task 1 - Add a Custom Domain

In your hosted lab environment, Adatum already has an existing on-premises domain titled **adatum.com**, along with a Microsoft 365 domain titled **xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**. In this lab, you will create a second Microsoft 365 domain for Adatum that will be titled **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx**; you will replace **xxxUPNxxx** with the UPN name (tenant prefix) assigned to your tenant by your lab hosting provider, and you will replace **xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** with your lab hosting provider's custom domain name. Your instructor will provide you with your lab hosting provider's custom domain name, as well as show you how to locate the UPN name.

1. In the prior lab exercises, you worked in LON-CL1. In this lab, you will be working from Adatum's domain controller, LON-DC1. <br/>

	Switch to **LON-DC1**.

2. On **LON-DC1**, you must select **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** to log in (your instructor will guide you on how to find this option in your VM environment). Log into LON-DC1 as the Adatum administrator account that was created by your lab hosting provider (**Administrator**) with the password **Pa55w.rd**. 

3. On LON-DC1, **Server Manager** automatically starts at boot-up. Do not close it, as you will use it later in this task. For now, simply minimize the Server Manager window. 

4. To create a new domain, you must first create a new Forward Lookup Zone in your on-premises DNS. To do so, you must open an elevated instance of **Windows PowerShell**. Select the magnifying glass (Search) icon on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen and type **power** in the Search box that appears. In the list of Apps in the search results, right-click on **Windows PowerShell** (do not select Windows PowerShell ISE) and select **Run as administrator** in the drop-down menu. 

5. Maximize your PowerShell window. In **Windows PowerShell**, type the following command at the command prompt to create a new Forward Lookup Zone in your on-premises DNS. When doing so, replace **xxxUPNxxx** with the unique UPN name (tenant prefix) assigned to your tenant by your lab hosting provider, and replace **xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** with your lab hosting provider's custom domain name. <br/>

		dnscmd /zoneadd xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx /DsPrimary
    
6. Minimize your Windows PowerShell window (do NOT close it as you will use it later).

7. On the taskbar at the bottom of your screen, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon. If necessary, maximize your browser window when it opens.

8. In your Edge browser, go to the **Microsoft 365 Home** page by entering the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com** 

9. In the **Sign in** window, enter **Holly@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider). Select **Next**.

10. In the **Enter password** window, enter the New Administrative Password that you assigned to Holly's account and then select **Sign in**. 

11. In the **Stay signed in?** window, select **Don't show this again** and then select **Yes**. In the **Save password** window, select **Never**.

12. If a **Welcome to Microsoft 365** dialog box appears in the middle of the screen, there's no option to close it. Instead, to the right of the window, select the right arrow icon (**>**) two times and then select the check mark icon to advance through the slides in this messaging window. 

13. If a **Find more apps** or **Introducing Microsoft Feed** or any other introductory-type window appears, select the **X** in the top corner of the window to close it. 

14. The **Welcome to Microsoft 365** page appears in your Edge browser in the **Home | Microsoft 365** tab. This is Holly's Microsoft 365 home page. In the column of application icons that appears on the far left-side of the screen, select **Admin**. This opens the Microsoft 365 admin center in a new browser tab. 

15. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **...Show all** in the navigation pane, select **Settings**, and then under the **Settings** group select **Domains**. 

16. On the **Domains** page, note that in the list of domains, only the **xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** domain appears. The existing on-premises **adatum.com** domain does not appear in the list of Microsoft 365 domains. To add Adatum's new Microsoft 365 domain, select **+Add domain** in the menu bar that appears above the list of domains. This will start the **Add domain** setup wizard. 

17. In the **Add domain** setup wizard, on the **Add a domain** page, enter the new domain name in the **Domain name** field. This should be the same domain name that you entered in the PowerShell command in step 5 when you created the new zone in DNS. Then select the **Use this domain** button that appears at the bottom of the page. 

18. In the **Verify you own your domain** page, you must select a verification method to prove you own the domain. For this lab, verify the **Add a TXT record to the domain's DNS records** option is selected by default (select this option if necessary) and then select **Continue**. 

19. On the **Add a record to verify ownership** page, you must copy the **TXT value** (NOT the TXT name) so that you can configure the domain later on in DNS Manager. To do so, select the **Copy record** icon that appears to the left of the **TXT value** (to the left of **MS=msXXXXXXXX**). If a dialog box appears, select **Allow access** to copy this value from the webpage to your clipboard.  <br/>

    ‎**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT select the **Verify** button at this point; instead, proceed to the next step. However, if you did select the **Verify** button, you will receive an error indicating the system could not find the record you added for this domain (you can do this if you want to see the error; there is no harm in it). Therefore, you must complete the next series of steps to add the TXT record to this domain in **DNS Manager**. Once you finish that process, you will be instructed to return back to this page and select the **Verify** button so that you can complete the process of adding this domain in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Therefore, proceed to the next step now.

20. Before you can verify you own this domain in the **Add domain** wizard, you must first add a DNS record for this domain in Server Manager. Select the **Server Manager** icon that appears in your taskbar at the bottom of the page. Maximize the Server Manager window if necessary.

21. In **Server Manager Dashboard,** select **Tools** in the top right corner of the window. In the drop-down menu that appears, select **DNS**, which will open **DNS Manager**. Maximize the DNS Manager window.

22. In the **DNS Manager** window, in the **File Explorer** section in the left-hand pane, select **LON-DC1** to expand it (if necessary). Under LON-DC1, expand the **Forward Lookup Zones** folder. In the list of Forward Lookup Zones in the side pane, select the **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** zone that you previously added in Windows PowerShell. Make sure you select this zone in the file tree in the side pane and not in the middle detail pane.

23. Right-click on this **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** zone that you previously selected in the side pane. In the menu that appears, select **Other New Records...** (Note: If you mistakenly right-click on the zone in the middle detail pane, the **Other New Records...** option will be disabled).

24. In the **Resource Record Type** window that appears, in the **Select a resource record type** field, scroll down and select **Text (TXT),** and then select the **Create Record...** button at the bottom of the window.

25. In the **New Resource Record** window that appears, in the **Text (TXT)** tab, leave the **Record name** field blank. However, right-click in the **Text** field and select **Paste** from the menu that appears. This will paste in the TXT value of **MS=msXXXXXXXX** that you copied to the clipboard when you were in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

26. Select **OK** to create the record. 

27. In the **Resource Record Type** window, select **Done**. Note how this Text (TXT) record appears in the middle detail pane for the xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx domain that you previously created. <br/>

	Leave your **DNS Manager** window open but minimize it as you will return to it in a later step in this task.  Minimize the **Server Manager** window as well. 

28. You are now ready to return to the Microsoft 365 admin center and resume adding the domain record. If you’ll recall, when you were earlier adding the domain in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you indicated that you wanted to verify the domain using a TXT record. At that point you had to switch to DNS Manager and add the TXT record. Now that you’ve added the TXT record, you can go back to the Microsoft 365 admin center and proceed with the domain verification process.<br/>

	‎In your Edge browser, you should be back in the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab that displays the **Add a record to verify ownership** page. The **TXT name** should display your UPN name (xxxUPNxxx) and the **TXT value** should display your MS=msXXXXXXXX value.

29. Select the **Verify** button that appears at the bottom of the page.  <br/>

	**Note:** If you selected **Verify** in the prior step when you copied the TXT value just to see the error that you would receive, the **Verify** button changed to **Try again**. In you did this, then select **Try again** rather than **Verify**. <br/>
	
	**WARNING:** It can sometimes take up 5 to 10 minutes for the DNS Manager change that you just made to propagate through the system, and sometimes it can take significantly longer depending on your registrar (in this case, your lab hosting provider). If you receive an error indicating the system could not detect the record that you added, wait 5 minutes and select the **Try again** button. Continue to do so every 5 minutes or so until the TXT record is successfully verified, at which point the **How do you want to connect to your domain?** window will appear.  <br/>

    ‎**CAUTION:** If you had a typo or any other configuration mistakes, the domain will not be verified. If this occurs, the **How do you want to connect to your domain?** window in the next step will not appear. In this case, select the **Back** button to repeat this task. Take your time when configuring the domain to make sure you don’t run into similar issues at this step in the process.

30. If your Text (TXT) record was successfully verified, the **How do you want to connect to your domain?** window will appear. Select **Continue**.

31. In the **Add DNS records** window, it enables you to add DNS records for three services that DNS supports - Exchange and Exchange Online Protection, Skype for Business, and Intune and Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365. <br/>

	**Exchange and Exchange Online Protection** is displayed by default and its check box is also selected by default. To see the other two services, scroll down and select **Advanced Options**. Note that under **Advanced Options**, neither the **Skype for Business** nor the **Intune and Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365** check boxes are selected. This is sufficient for Adatum; you should NOT select either of these two check boxes. Only the **Exchange and Exchange Online Protection** check box should be selected. <br/>
	
	Under the **Exchange and Exchange Online Protection** service, the description indicates that 3 DNS records are needed for it to work properly: a Mail Exchanger (MX) record, an Alias (CNAME) record, and an additional Text (TXT) record. You must now switch back and forth between this **Add DNS records** page and **DNS Manager** to add these three additional DNS records for the new domain. For each DNS record that you add in DNS Manager, you will copy information from this **Add DNS records** page and then paste it into each corresponding record that you create in DNS Manager.  <br/>

	On the **Add DNS records** page, under the **Exchange and Exchange Online Protection** section, select the forward arrow (**>**) in the **MX Records (1)** section to expand it. This displays the **Expected value** that the domain setup wizard expects to see in the MX record that you create for this domain in DNS Manager. <br/>
	
	Then select the forward arrows (**>**) in the **CNAME Records (1)** section and the **TXT Records (1)** section. All three record types should now be expanded.
	
32. You will begin by adding the **MX record** required by the **Exchange and Exchange Online Protection** service.  <br/>

	a. In the **MX Records (1)** section, under the **Points to address or value** column, select the copy icon that appears to the left of the expected value (for example, xxxUPNxxx-xxxCustomDomainxxx-xxx.mail.protection.outlook.com) to copy this value to the clipboard. If a dialog box appears, select **Allow access** to allow the webpage to copy the value to the clipboard.
	
	b. You must now switch to DNS Manager. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, select the **DNS Manager** icon.

	c. In **DNS Manager**, under **Forward Lookup Zones** in the side pane, the **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** domain should be selected from when you earlier left off. If not, select this zone now. You should see the **TXT** record that you created earlier. You must now create a **Mail Exchanger (MX)** record for this domain. Under **Forward Lookup Zones**, right-click the **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** domain and select **New Mail Exchanger (MX)...**

	d. In the **New Resource Record** window, in the **Mail Exchanger (MX)** tab, leave the **Host or child domain** field blank, but right-click in the **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of mail server** field and select **Paste** from the menu that appears. This will paste in the expected **Points to address or value** that you copied to the clipboard in **step a** above.
	
	e. In the **New Resource Record** window, select **OK**. Note how this Mail Exchanger (MX) record appears in the detail pane on the right for the xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx domain that you previously created. Leave your DNS Manager window open as you will return to it in a later step in this task.
	
	f. Switch back to the **Add DNS records** page in the Microsoft 365 admin center by selecting the **Microsoft Edge** icon on the taskbar at the bottom of the page. At this point, you can either select **Continue** at the bottom of the **Add DNS records** page to verify the MX record that you just added, or you can wait until you have added all three DNS records and then select **Continue** to verify all three records at once. 
	
	**For the purposes of this lab, you will verify each DNS record as you create it.** Therefore, select **Continue**. On the **Add DNS records** page, if an error message appears indicating the name server (NS) or Start of Authority (SOA) records for your domain aren't set up correctly, you can ignore it because you haven't created all the necessary DNS records. Instead, scross down to the **MX Records (1)** section, which should display either a checkmark or an exclamation point next to **MX Records (1)**. A checkmark in a green circle indicates that it successfully validated the MX record for this domain in DNS Manager, but an exclamation point in a red circle indicates there was a problem with the MX record and it did not validate successfully. If the MX record did not validate successfully, then review the DNS record in DNS Manager to ensure you entered the proper information, make any necessary corrections, and then select **Continue** again. <br/>

	**Note:** Since you only created an MX Record in DNS Manager, an exclamation point in a red circle should appear next to the **CNAME records (1)** section and the **TXT Records (1)** section. **This is to be expected, since you have yet to create their corresponding DNS records.** Also, note that a message appears in a red message box at the top of the page indicating that it detected missing records. This too is to be expected since you only created the MX record and not the CNAME and TXT records. Ignore this message. 

33. Once a checkmark appears next to **MX Records (1)**, you must perform the following steps to add the **CNAME record** required by Exchange and Exchange Online Protection service.  <br/>

	a. On the **Add DNS records** page, in the **CNAME Records (1)** section, under the **Points to address or value** column, select the copy icon that appears to the left of the expected value (for example, autodiscover.outlook.com). <br/>
		
	**Important:** You will NOT copy the expected **Host Name** value. The value listed here as the expected host name is **autodiscover.xxxUPNxxx** (where xxxUPNxxx is your UPN name). However, if you paste this value in the **Alias name** field in the CNAME record in DNS Manager, the CNAME record validation on this page will fail. When you create the CNAME record in DNS Manager in the following steps, you will simply enter **autodiscover** as the **Alias name** and NOT **autodiscover.xxxUPNxxx**. <br/>
	
	The reason for using only **autodiscover** as the **Alias name** is that Autodiscover is an Exchange service that minimizes configuration and deployment. For small, single SMTP namespace organizations such as Adatum, only autodiscover is needed as the Alias, as opposed to autodiscover.xxxUPNxxx for larger organizations with multiple SMTP namespaces. By adding the CNAME record to your on-premises DNS server, you're creating a redirect record that allows users to configure Outlook and access Outlook Web App (OWA) by using either Basic Authentication or Modern Authentication(OAUTH). <br/>
	
	Therefore, the only value you need to copy for the CNAME record is the expected value for the **Points to address or value** column (for example, autodiscover.outlook.com). <br/>

	b. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, select the **DNS Manager** icon.

	c. In **DNS Manager**, under **Forward Lookup Zones**, right-click the **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** domain and select **New Alias (CNAME)...**

	d. In the **New Resource Record** window, enter **autodiscover** in the **Alias name (uses parent domain if left blank)** field. 
	
	e. Right-click in the **Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for target host** field and select **Paste** from the menu that appears. This will paste in the expected **Points to address or value** that you earlier copied to the clipboard.
	
	f. In the **New Resource Record** window, select **OK**. Note how this Alias (CNAME) record appears in the detail pane on the right for the xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx domain that you previously created. Leave your DNS Manager window open as you will return to it in a later step in this task.
	
	g. Select the **Edge** browser icon on your taskbar to switch back to the Microsoft 365 admin center. Since you're validating each DNS record as you create them, on the **Add DNS records** page, select **Continue** at the bottom of the page to verify the CNAME record. <br/>
	
	The verification process will display either a checkmark or an exclamation point next to **CNAME Records (1)**. A checkmark in a green circle indicates that it successfully validated the CNAME record for this domain in DNS Manager, but an exclamation point in a red circle indicates there was a problem with the CNAME record and it did not validate successfully. If the CNAME record did not validate successfully, then review the DNS record to ensure you entered the proper information, make any necessary corrections, and then select **Continue** again.  <br/>

	**Note:** Since you only created a CNAME Record in DNS Manager, an exclamation point in a red circle should appear next to the **TXT Records (1)** section. **This is to be expected, since you have yet to create its corresponding DNS record.** Also, note that a message appears in a red message box at the top of the page indicating that it detected missing records. This too is to be expected since you only created the MX and CNAME records and not the TXT record. Ignore this message. <br/>

	**Note:** Sometimes during our testing of this lab, we experienced a quirky situation when validating the CNAME record. While the CNAME record validated successfully, the MX Records (1) section, which previously displayed a green check mark, suddenly displayed a red exclamation point and an error message indicating that it couldn't find the MX record. If this occurs, simply ignore this error. Once we validated the final TXT record at then end of the lab, all three records validated successfully. Therefore, this strange situation in which it said that it couldn't validate the MX record after having previously validated it is just an anomaly that you can ignore. 
	
34. Once a checkmark appears next to **CNAME Records (1)**, you will finish by adding the **TXT record** required by Exchange and Exchange Online Protection service.  <br/>

	a. On the **Add DNS records** page, in the **TXT Records (1)** section, under the **TXT value** column, select the copy icon that appears to the left of the expected value (for example, v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all) to copy this value to the clipboard.

	b. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, select the **DNS Manager** icon.

	c. In **DNS Manager**, under **Forward Lookup Zones**, right-click the **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** domain and select **Other New Records...**
	
	d. In the **Resource Record Type** window that appears, in the **Select a resource record type** field, scroll down and select **Text (TXT),** and then select the **Create Record...** button at the bottom of the window.

	e. In the **New Resource Record** window, in the **Text (TXT)** tab, leave the **Record name** field blank. However, right-click in the **Text** field and select **Paste** from the menu that appears. This will paste in the expected **TXT value** that you earlier copied to the clipboard.
	
	f. In the **New Resource Record** window, select **OK**. 
	
	g. On the **Resource Record Type** window, select **Done**. 

35. In **DNS Manager**, you should now see the TXT record that you originally created to verify the domain, along with the MX, CNAME, and TXT records that you created for the Exchange service to work within this domain. <br/>

	Minimize the **DNS Manager** window. 

36. This should return you to the **Add DNS records** page in your Edge browser. Select **Continue** to complete the new domain setup. If you selected **Continue** after adding the MX and CNAME records, and if each validated successfully, then only the TXT record will be validated at this point. However, if you did not select **Continue** after adding the MX and CNAME records, then all three records will be validated at this point. <br/>
	
	If all three records have been successfully validated, then the **Domain setup is complete** page will appear. If this occurs, then select the **Done** button to complete the domain setup process. <br/>
	
	However, if any of the three records did not validate successfully, then the **Add DNS records** window will return, and it will display either a checkmark or an exclamation point next to each record type to indicate which ones validated successfully and which ones did not. An exclamation point in a red circle indicates that there was a problem with the corresponding DNS record and it did not validate successfully (note that the Actual value for the record is left blank). If this occurs, you must correct the data on the corresponding record in DNS Manager and then select **Continue** again. You must repeat this process until all three records have successfully validated and the **Domain setup is complete** page appears.

37. Once the domain setup process is complete and the three DNS records validated successfully for the **Exchange and Exchange Online Protection** service, the **Domains** page will be displayed. Verify the **Domain status** is **Healthy** for the **xxxUPNxxx.xxxCustomDomainxxx.xxx** domain, which should now appear in the list of domains. This new domain should also be flagged as the Default domain for Adatum. 

38. Holly is now yet ready to implement the new domain in Adatum's Microsoft 365 deployment. Therefore, ensure the **xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** domain is still listed as the default domain. If it is not, select the vertical ellipsis (**More actions**) icon to the right of the domain, and then select **Set as default**.

39. Remain logged into the LON-DC1 VM with both **Microsoft Edge** and **Windows PowerShell** left open. You will return to LON-DC1 in a later lab that performs identity synchronization. 

# End of  Lab 1
