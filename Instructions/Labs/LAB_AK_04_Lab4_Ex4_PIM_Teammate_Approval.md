# Learning Path 4 - Lab 4 - Exercise 4 - PIM Teammate Approval Request

Up to this point, you have conducted two forms of PIM approval:

- One by an administrator (Holly), who approved the activation and assignment of the Global Administrator role to Patti Fernandez.
- Another by Alex Wilber, who self-approved the assignment of the Helpdesk administrator role to his user account. 

In this exercise, you will conduct a third form of PIM approval, which is having a non-admin user approve the assignment of a role to another user. 

In an attempt to decrease overhead but still maintain a secure way of managing administrator roles, Holly decided to allow Alex Wilber and Joni Sherman to approve each otherâ€™s request to activate the Intune Administrator role.  This will allow Alex and Joni to perform device management tasks within Intune without having to wait for Holly to approve their requests. 


### Task 1 - Create an eligible group for the Intune Admin role

For this final test of PIM in Adatum's pilot project, Holly has selected Alex Wilber and Joni Sherman to be eligible for the Intune admin role. To simplify future role assignments, Holly wants to create a security group, assign Alex and Joni to the group, and then assign the group to the Intune admin role - just as she previously did in the prior lab exercise for the Helpdesk administrator role. 

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **adatum\administrator** account, and in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson.

2. In your Edge browser, select the tab containing the **Microsoft Entra admin center**, which should still be open from the prior lab exercise. 

3. In the **Microsoft Entra admin center**, select **Groups** in the navigation pane, and then select **All groups**.

4. In the **Groups | All groups** window, select **New group** in the menu bar.

5. In the **New group** window, enter the following information:

    - Group type - **Security**

    - Group name - **PIM-Intune-Administrators**

    - Group description - **Group of eligible users who can be assigned to the Intune Administrator role in PIM**

    - Microsoft Entra roles can be assigned to the group - **Yes**

    - Membership type - **Assigned**

    - Owners - Select **No owners selected**. In the **Add owners** pane, enter **Holly** in the **Search** field and select the **Holly@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** user account

    - Members - Select **No members selected**. In the **Add members** pane, select **Alex Wilber**. Enter **Joni** in the Search field, and then select **Joni Sherman**.

6. In the **New group** window, select **Create**.

7. A dialog box appears towards the top of the page that says: **Creating a group to which Microsoft Entra roles can be assigned is a setting that cannot be changed later. Are you sure that you want to add this capability?**. Select **Yes**.

8. On the **Groups | All groups** window, if the **PIM-Intune-Administrators** group does not appear, select **Refresh** on the menu bar. It may take a few minutes for the group to appear.

9. You must now make the **PIM-Intune-Administrators** group eligible for role assignment. In the **Microsoft Entra admin center** navigation pane, under the **ID Governance** section, select **Privileged Identity Management**.

10. In the **Privileged Identity Management | Quick start** window, in the middle pane under the **Manage** section, select **Microsoft Entra roles**.

11. In the **Adatum Corporation | Quick start** window, under the **Assign** section, select the **Assign Eligibility** button.

12. In the **Adatum Corporation | Roles** window, scroll down through the list of roles and select **Intune Administrator**.

13. In the **Intune Administrator | Assignments** window, select **+Add assignments** on the menu bar. 

14. In the **Add assignments** window, the **Membership** tab is displayed by default. Under **Select member(s)**, select **No member selected**.

15. In the **Select a member** pane that appears on the right, enter **PIM** in the **Search** field. This will display the list of eligible users and groups whose name starts with **PIM**. Select the **PIM-Intune-Administrators** group that appears, and then select the **Select** button.

16. In the **Add assignments** window, select **Next** (this does the same thing as selecting the **Setting** tab). 

17. In the **Add assignments** window, under the **Setting** tab, verify the **Assignment type** option is set to **Eligible**. Also verify the **Permanently eligible** check box is selected (if not, then do so now), and then select **Assign**. 

18. In the **Intune Administrator | Assignments** window, note that the **PIM-Intune-Administrators** group is an eligible assignment to the Intune Administrator role. Because **PIM-Intune-Administrators** is a group, it means that all members of this group (which consists of Alex Wilber and Joni Sherman) are now eligible to be assigned the Intune Administrator role.

    **Note:** Lab testing has shown that it can sometimes take up to 30 minutes for new assignments to appear under the **Eligible assignments** tab. If **PIM-Intune-Administrators** doesn't appear immediately, wait a few minutes and then select the **Refresh** option on the menu bar. Continue to select the **Refresh** option every few minutes until **PIM-Intune-Administrators** appears in the list of **Eligible assignments**.
1921. Leave all browser tabs open for the next task.


### Task 2 - Configure the Intune Administrator role to require approval

In this exercise, Holly will enable the PIM-Intune-Administrators group to be eligible for the Intune admin role. However, not only will Holly make the group eligible for the role, but she will also make its members approvers of the role requests. Holly will then configure the role so that PIM notifies her of all approvals for this role.

As in the prior PIM exercise involving the Helpdesk admin role, Holly is trusting that Alex and Joni won't activate the Intune admin role unless they're required to do so. Therefore, Holly will only require that Alex and Joni provide a justification whenever they must activate the role. In addition, Holly wants to configure the role so that Alex and Joni can approve each other's request for role activation. Holly simply wants to be notified whenever either user approves a request from the other.

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson.

2. In your browser, you should still have the **Microsoft Entra admin center** open from the prior task. In the navigation pane, under the **ID Governance** section, select **Privileged Identity Management**.

3. In the **Privileged Identity Management | Quick start** window, in the middle pane under the **Manage** section, select **Microsoft Entra roles**.

4. In the **Adatum Corporation | Quick start** window, in the middle pane under the **Manage** section, select **Settings**. 

5. In the **Adatum Corporation | Settings** window, select the **Intune Administrator** role.    <br/>

    **Tip:** If the roles are not displayed in alphabetical order, select the **Role** heading to sort them in ascending alphabetical order. This will make it easier to locate the Intune administrator role.

6. In the **Role setting details -  Intune Administrator** window, scroll through the page and review the information for role activation, assignment, and notification. Then select **Edit** on the menu bar at the top of the page.

7. Below the activation slider, set the **On activation, require** setting to **None**. <br/>

    **Note:** In a previous lab exercise, Holly required that Patti Fernandez sign in using Microsoft Entra MFA when she requested activation of the Global admin role. In doing so, Holly verified the Microsoft Entra MFA sign-in worked. However, for the purpose of the pilot project, Holly will not require verification using multi-factor authentication when activating the Intune administrator role (and since you already tested this MFA feature in the prior lab exercise, there's no reason to take time in class to do it again). 

8. In the **Edit role setting - Intune Administrator** window, the **Activation** tab is displayed by default. For the pilot project, Holly does not want the **Require justification on activation** check box selected. If this check box is selected, then un-select (clear) it now. Holly knows that Alex and Joni will only activate the role when needed, so she doesn't require a justification from them to activate the role assignment (however, in the next step, Holly will require justification when they request assignment of the role). 

9. Select the **Require approval to activate** check box. By doing so, the **Select approver(s)** section becomes enabled.

10. In the **Select approver(s)** section, no specific approver has been selected. Holly wants to assign the members of the PIM-Intune-Administrators group as the approver for this role, so select this section. 

11. In the **Select a member** pane that appears, enter **PIM** in the Search box. In the list of users and groups whose name starts with **PIM**, select **PIM-Intune-Administrators** and then select the **Select** button. By selecting this group, the members of the group will receive notification to approve the request made by any eligible user for this role.

12. In the **Edit role setting - Intune Administrator** window, you're currently in the **Activation** tab. Select the **Assignment** tab that appears next to it. Verify the **Require justification on active assignment** check box is selected (if not, select it now).

13. In the **Edit role setting - Intune Administrator** window, select the **Notification** tab.

14. On the **Notification** tab, under the **Send notifications when eligible members activate this role** section, Holly wants to be notified when Alex or Joni approve this role. Therefore:

    - Verify the **Role activation alert** check box is selected.
    - The default recipient for the **Role activation alert** is **Admin**. This refers to the Global Administrators (Holly) and any Privileged Role Administrators. 
    - Un-check (clear) the **Notification to activated user (requestor)**. Since Alex and Joni will be approving each other's requests, they don't need to receive a notification when they do so.
    -  Verify the **Request to approve an activation** check box is selected. 

15. At the bottom of the **Edit role setting - Intune Administrator** window, select **Update**.

16. Leave all browser tabs open for the next task.


### Task 3 - Submit a request for the Intune Admin role

At this point in Holly's pilot project, the **PIM-Intune-Administrators** group has been made eligible for the Intune administrator role. Each member of the group (in this case, Alex Wilber and Joni Sherman) can now be assigned the Intune Administrator role by requesting approval from a member of this group, which in this case will be the other person. Holly wants to test out the PIM process in her pilot project. In this task, you will take on the role of Joni Sherman, who will submit a request to approve assigning the Intune Administrator role to her account. 

1.  In LON-CL1, right-click on the **Edge** icon on the taskbar and in the menu that appears, select **New InPrivate window**. 

2. In your InPrivate browsing session, enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.azure.com**

3. You're now going to log into Azure as Joni Sherman. In the **Sign in** window, enter **JoniS@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider) and then select **Next**. In the **Enter password** window, enter the **User Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**. <br/>

    In the **Update your password** window that appears, enter the **User Password** provided by your lab hosting provider in the **Current password** field. Then in the **New password** and **Confirm password** fields, enter the New User Password that you defined for all test users at the start of the lab. Select **Sign in**.

4. In the **Stay signed in?** dialog box, select the **Don't show this again** check box and then select **Yes**.

5. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** dialog box appears, select **Cancel** to skip the tour.

6. In the **Microsoft Azure** portal, in the middle of the screen is the section of **Azure services**. This section displays a row of Azure services and their associated icons. At the end of the row, select **More services** (with the forward arrow icon). This opens the **All services** window.

7. In the **All services** window, enter **priv** in the **Filter services** search box at the top of the page. In the list of search results, select **Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management**.

8. In the **Privileged Identity Management | Quick start** window, in the **Tasks** section in the navigation pane, select **My Roles**.

9. In the **My roles | Microsoft Entra roles** window, the **Eligible assignments** tab is displayed by default. Remember, in the prior task Holly assigned Joni and Alex as members of the **PIM-Intune-Administrators** group, which Holly later assigned as an eligible group for the Intune Administrator role. As such, this role appears in the list of **Eligible assignments** for Joni. Under the **Action** column for the Intune Administrator role, select **Activate**.

10. In the **Activate - Intune Administrator** pane that appears, enter **Device management support requests from various users that require resolution** in the **Reason** field, and then select the **Activate** button at the bottom of the pane.

11. On the **My roles | Microsoft Entra roles** window, the **Eligible assignments** tab is displayed on the menu bar. Select the **Active assignments** tab that appears next to it. Note that no roles appear. <br/>

     **Note:** If the prior task, Holly set up the Intune Administrator role so that activation to a user account will require approval by a member of the PIM-Intune-Administrators group. What Joni just did was request that the Intune Admin role be activated for her user account. This will send a notification request to the members of the PIM-Intune-Administrators group to approve Joni's request. Since Alex Wilber is a member of the group, he can then either approve or deny Joni's request for role activation. Alex will review this request in the next task.

12. Leave the InPrivate browser session open for the next task.


### Task 4 -  Approve the request for the Intune Admin role

Back in Task 2, Holly assigned the PIM-Intune-Administrators group as approver for the Intune Administrator role. This means that both Joni and Alex, as members of the group, can approve requests for role assignment. Since Joni submitted a role assignment request in the prior task, Alex must review the request and determine whether to accept or deny it. 

As a member of the PIM-Intune-Administrators group, Joni can approve requests for the Intune Admin role. But since Joni also requested assignment of this role, she should not be able to self-approve her own request. Only another member of the group (in this case, Alex) should be able to approve her request. In this task, you first want to verify that Joni can't self-approve her own request. 

1. You should still be logged into the InPrivate browser session as Joni Sherman. If you closed the session at the end of the prior task, then repeat the steps from the prior task to open the InPrivate browsing session, sign in as Joni, and navigate to the **My roles** window. 

2. You want to begin by verifying that Joni can't self-approve her own request for the Intune Admin role. You're currently in the **My roles | Microsoft Entra roles** window, where you left off from the prior task. In the navigation thread at the top of the window (**All services > Privileged Identity Management | My roles**), select **Privileged Identity Management | My roles**.

3. In the **Privileged Identity Management | Quick start** window, in the **Tasks** section in the navigation pane, select **Approve requests**.

4. In the **Approve requests | Microsoft Entra roles** window, there are two sections - **Requests to renew or extend role assignments**, and **Requests for role activations**. Under the **Requests to renew or extend role assignments** section, note that Joni has no requests pending approval. <br/>

    **Important:** You have just verified that Joni can't self-approve her own request for the Intune Administrator role, even though she's a member of the PIM-Intune-Administrators group. One of the other members of the group must approve Joni's request. You'll do this in the remaining steps of this task, where Alex will approve her request. 

5. Close the InPrivate browsing session. 

6. You will now open a new InPrivate browsing session for Alex Wilber to approve Joni's activation request for the Intune Administrator role. In LON-CL1, right-click on the **Edge** icon on the taskbar and in the menu that appears, select **New InPrivate window**. 

7. In your InPrivate browsing session, enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.azure.com**

8. You're now going to log into Azure as Alex Wilber. In the **Sign in** window, enter **AlexW@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider) and then select **Next**. In the **Enter password** window, enter the New User Password that you assigned to Alex's account when you signed previously signed in as Alex in the prior lab exercise. Select **Sign in**. 

9. In the **Stay signed in?** dialog box, select the **Don't show this again** check box and then select **Yes**.

10. If a **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** dialog box appears, select **Cancel** to skip the tour.

11. In the **Microsoft Azure** portal, in the middle of the screen is the section of **Azure services**. Select **More services** (with the forward arrow icon). This opens the **All services** window.

12. In the **All services** window, enter **priv** in the **Search** box at the top of the page. In the list of search results, select **Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management**.

13. In the **Privileged Identity Management | Quick start** window, in the **Tasks** section in the navigation pane, select **Approve requests**.

14. In the **Approve requests | Microsoft Entra roles** window, in the **Requests for role activations** section, select the check box to the left of the **Intune Administrator** request from Joni Sherman, and then select the **Approve** button.

15. In the **Approve Request** pane that appears on the right-side of the screen, enter **PIM testing** in the **Justification** field and then select **Confirm**.

16. Close the InPrivate browser session for Alex.

17. You will now open a new InPrivate browser session for Joni to verify she was assigned the Intune Administrator role. In your InPrivate browsing session, enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.azure.com**

18. You're now going to log into Azure as Joni Sherman. In the **Sign in** window, enter **JoniS@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your lab hosting provider) and then select **Next**. In the **Enter password** window, enter the New User Password that you changed Joni's password to when you signed in as her in the prior task. Select **Sign in**. 

19. In the **Stay signed in?** dialog box, select the **Don't show this again** check box and then select **Yes**.

20. In the **Microsoft Azure** portal, in the middle of the screen is the section of **Azure services**. Select **More services** (with the forward arrow icon). This opens the **All services** window.

21. In the **All services** window, enter **priv** in the **Filter services** search box at the top of the page. In the list of search results, select **Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management**.

22. In the **Privileged Identity Management | Quick start** window, in the **Tasks** section in the navigation pane, select **My roles**.

23.  In the **My roles | Microsoft Entra roles** window, the **Eligible assignments** tab is displayed by default. Select the **Active assignments** tab. Note the Intune Administrator role is now activated for Joni. 

24. Close the InPrivate browser session.

25. Leave your Edge browser and all tabs open. 


### Task 5 -  Verify a PIM notification was issued

When you earlier configured the Intune Administrator role, you set up the notification feature so that Holly would be notified any time an eligible user activated the role. Since Alex Wilber just activated the role for Joni Sherman, Holly should receive a notification of this activity. This task will verify that Holly received this notification. 

1. On LON-CL1, in your Edge browser, you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson.

2. In your Edge browser, you should still have the Outlook tab open from the prior lab exercise in which you verified that Holly received an email notification that Alex Wilber had self-approved the Helpdesk Administrator role. Select the **Outlook** tab in your Edge browser session to return to Holly's Inbox. 

3. In Holly's **Inbox**, she should have received an email indicating **PIM: Joni Sherman activated the Intune Administrator role assignment**.

4. Select the email to open it. Review the information in the email. 

5. To review the audited list of activities related to Joni's approval of the Intune Administrator role, select the **Microsoft Entra admin center** tab in your Edge browser. 

6. In the **Microsoft Entra admin center**, the **Adatum Corporation - Settings** page should be displayed. This is where you left off in an earlier task. In the middle pane, under the **Activity** section towards the bottom of the page, select **Resource audit**.

7. In the **Adatum Corporation | Resource audit** page, review the list of PIM activities. Note the two most recent activities. Select the second activity, where the requestor is Alex Wilber. In the **Audit details** pane that appears, note the **Subject** is Joni Sherman, and the **Action** indicates Alex approved Joni's role request for the Intune Administrator role. Select **Close**.

8. In the **Adatum Corporation | Resource audit** page, in the list of PIM activities, select the first activity. In the **Audit details** pane that appears, note the **Subject** is Joni Sherman, and the **Action** indicates Joni was added to the Intune Administrator role. Also note the **Reason** that you entered for the role request. Select **Close**.

9. In your Edge browser session, close all the tabs except for the **Home | Microsoft 365** tab and the tab containing the **Microsoft 365 admin center**. Leave these two tabs open for the next lab.


# End of Lab 4
